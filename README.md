# Buy Give Share Project Documentation

## Project Overview

Buy Give Share is a platform designed to connect businesses and charities to facilitate transparent donations. This document outlines the project's architecture, including the backend server setup and the frontend application structure, which is built using React.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

The frontend of the Buy Give Share project is built using **React**, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces for web applications.

### Backend

The backend is structured around **Node.js** and **Express.js**, providing a robust server-side platform that handles HTTP requests, business logic, and data management.

## Repository Structure

### Backend

Located in the `backend` folder, responsible for API services, database management, and server-side logic.

**Components:**
- **`server.js`**: Initializes the Express server and defines API routes.

### Frontend

Developed using React and organized into components and utility files.

**Key Files and Directories:**
- **`src`**: Main directory for React components and application logic.
  - **`App.js`**: Serves as the root component that orchestrates the rendering of the entire application.
  - **`index.js`**: Entry point for React rendering, setting up the root component and linking to the HTML document.
  - **`setupTests.js`**: Configures the testing framework for React components.
  - **`/components`**: Houses reusable React components such as `LandingPage`.

## Usage

The Buy Give Share project will eventually be published and hosted on [buygiveshare.com](http://buygiveshare.com). Users will be able to access the application through this domain. 
The platform will connect with Clover's API to allow businesses and charities to track and manage donations seamlessly.
